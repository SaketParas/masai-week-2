                        <h4>The shell almost always has a circular opening over which the drumhead is stretched, but the shape of
                             the remainder of the shell varies widely. In the Western musical tradition, the most usual shape is
                              a cylinder, although timpani, for example, use bowl-shaped shells.[1] Other shapes include a frame 
                              design (tar, Bodhr√°n), truncated cones (bongo drums, Ashiko), goblet shaped (djembe), and joined 
                              truncated cones (talking drum).<br>
                                Drums with cylindrical shells can be open at one end (as is the case with timbales), or can have
                                 two drum heads, one head on each end. Single-headed drums typically consist of a skin stretched 
                                 over an enclosed space, or over one of the ends of a hollow vessel.<br> Drums with two heads covering
                                  both ends of a cylindrical shell often have a small hole somewhat halfway between the two heads;
                                   the shell forms a resonating chamber for the resulting sound. Exceptions include the African
                                    slit drum, also known as a log drum as it is made from a hollowed-out tree trunk, and the
                                     Caribbean steel drum, made from a metal barrel. Drums with two heads can also have a set 
                                     of wires, called snares, held across the bottom head, top head, or both heads, hence the
                                      name snare drum.[1] On some drums with two heads, a hole or bass reflex port may be cut or
                                       installed onto one head, as with some 2010s era bass drums in rock music.</h4>
